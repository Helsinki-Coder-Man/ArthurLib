ArthurLib is a work-in-progress Linear Algebra Library. With Matrices,Vectors and some trigonomic frunctions.
(A full length manual will be written at a later date)

Current features:

- Vector struct : Includes two scalar variables, Direction and magnitude.
  - Ability to add and multiply
  
- Matrix struct : Has a two dimensional array using standard arrays.
  - Ability to add and multiply

- Trigonometry
  - Function, Theta ,used to find the angle theta on a right triangle formed from two vectors.
